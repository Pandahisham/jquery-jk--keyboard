# jQuery-jk

Lightweight jQuery plugin for traversing lists of things
like you do with Gmail messages.

## Usage

Just add the class name "jk" to something like a `ul` tag,
and all its `li` children will be considered traversable.

When an item has focus, it gets the class name `focus`.

When an item is selected, it gets the class name `selected`.

**View the spec/suite.html** for more info.

### Events

Custom events are triggered when an element gets/loses focus
or selection.
